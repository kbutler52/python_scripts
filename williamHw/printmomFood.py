#program from yesterdays lesson

# momsFood = "Mom has this many avocados: "
# print(momsFood + "3")

#program #2 from yesterday's lesson- the below program will not work
#becuase 3 is a  integer  and needs to be converted to a string
#like the one above

# momsFood= "Mom has this many avocados: "
# print(momsFood+3)

# Format the string
#3 ways
#%: %d-decimal;  %f-float; %s-string
#.format()
#f""
# format the string- This program works

# advocadoCount = 3
# momsFood = "Mom has this many avocados: "
# print(momsFood+ "%d" %(advocadoCount))


#Format the string:the program works
# avocadoCount = 3
# momsFood = " Mom has this many avocados: "
# print(momsFood+ "{}".format(avocadoCount))

# print with f string this is the most powerful of them all

# avocadoCount = 3
# momsFood = "Mom has this many avocados: "
# print(momsFood + f"{avocadoCount}")
