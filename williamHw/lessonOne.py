# learing print formatting

print(f" I have {3} Avocados") #this allow the number three to become a string# this is william's favorite
print(" I have %d Strawberries" %(2))#the %d the % to take the number 2 and turn a string and place it in here.
print("I have  {} canalope"  .format (1))# what is happening here is where the print statement see {}, it says whatevr #follows .format turn that into a string and place it here.

#these are just three ways that we do print formats.
