#for Loop
#contains predefined start, stop, and iteration
#Runs the loop until stop condition is met
#Bettr for data structrues: List,sets,tuple, dictionaries...
#Foramt of a For loop below
#for <varialbe> in <predefined>:
#<Run Code>
#this for loop is safer that While loop
#Example the program before I write it out

#avocadoCount = 10
#for days in range(avocadoCount, 0, -1)
#print("Mom has this {} avocados". .format())
#what is start? Stop? Step?
#How does just the number print in each loop?

#for loop example
avocadoCount = 10#starting condition
for days in range(avocadoCount, 0,-1):#because we are going down we have to use the step function
    print(f"Mom has %d avocados" %(days))
