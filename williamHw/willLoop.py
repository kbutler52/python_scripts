#Agenda
#Go over start and stop conditions
#Go over interations / Step
#Go over while loops
#Go over for loops
#Start condition: Tells the loop what index or value to start at
#Stop condition: Tells the loop what index or value to stop at
#Iteration / Step: Change in the index or value as the loop runs

#Example
#0,1,2,3,4,5
#Start condition: 0( Start at first element)
#Stop condition:5(Stop at last element)
#Iteration / Step: 1(visit every value)
#0,1,2,3,4,5
#Interation /Step: 2 (visit every OTHER elemt)
#0,2,4
#As long as the condition is true, the loop runs.
#While loops are better for Variables( numbers)
#While loop format:
# While(true):
#    <Run Code>
# using a while loop 1st
#start = 0#start condition
#while start<=5:# this isour stop condition
   #print(start)
   #start = start + 1
# another while Loop example- the one above is just Commented out
#Example of the code before I type it out
#avocadoCount = 10
#while(avoacadoCount > 0):
#print("Mom has this {} avocados". format(avocado))
#avocadoCount = avocadoCount - 1

avocadoCount = 10#Start condtion
while(avocadoCount > 0):#stop Condition
    print(f"Mom has  {avocadoCount}  Avocados")
    avocadoCount = avocadoCount -1#Iteration / Step
