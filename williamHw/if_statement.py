#(10 > 5)
#(10< 5)
#10 == 5)

#print(10>5)
#print(10 < 5)
#print 10 == 5)
#Example 1 Commented out
#avocados = 5
#strawberries = 5
#if avocados .  strawberries:
   #print("we have more avocados that strawberries")
#print(avocados > strawberries)

#Example 2 if/else
#avocados = 10
#strawberries = 5
#print avocados > strawberries)
#print(not(avocados > strawberries))

#if avocados > strawberries:
   # print("We have more avocados that strawberries")
#else:
   #("We have less avocados thatn strawberries")

#Example 3 if/elif/else statement
# works like if, its condition is only evaluated when the if condition is false
# it better refines the esle condtion
#if(False):
# elif(False):
#else:
#<runs>


avocados = 10
strawberries = 10
#Determine if you have more , equal to , orless avocados than strawberries.
print(avocados > strawberries)
print(avocados == strawberries)
print(avocados < strawberries)

if avocados > strawberries:
    print("we have more avocados than strawberries")
elif avocados ==strawberries:
    print("We have equal amount of avocados and strawberries")
else:
    print("We have less avocados than strawberries")
