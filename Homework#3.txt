Homework #3: Due: 01/04/2020

In homework 3, I want to learn more about you.
Create a python file named Kyla_Library.py. In this file create a class named Kyla.

create the __init__(...) function.
	In this function,set the object name to your name and the object city name to Brooklyn
	In this function, make a print statement that Introduces yourself in the following format:
	"Hi, my name is Kyla and I am from Brooklyn"

Create a function named Favorite_places(...).
	WHen this function is called, enter three of your favorite cities and add them to a list.
	In this function, make a print statement that outputs your favorite cities in the following format:
	"My favorite cities are:
	____
	____
	____"

Create a function named Favorite_foods(...) that checks if a food is in a set of foods.
	When this function is called, enter a string. If that string is a food in the set of foods, print:<string>+" is one of my favorite foods"
	If that string is not a food in the set of foods, print:<string>+" is not one of my favorite foods"

Finally, Make a seperate python file called MyFile.py that imports your Kyla_Library.py file and call all of the functions in the Kyla class.

In total you should be pushing 2 files to your GitHub repository:
	Kyla_Library.py
	MyFile.py

Emailed you you was a picture of the expected output

I am more than happy to help out where needed, some of these topics may not have been covered. However, I believe this exercise will wrap up your introduction to pyhton.

Anything you do past this point will be a combination, or alteration of everything else you have already done. As always debugging and investigating are required in any situation.
